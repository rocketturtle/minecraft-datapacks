# About

Use hoes to forage for seeds in grass and to harvest saplings from leaves.  Better quality hoes have better yields!

# Details

Increases the drop chance of leaf items with each tier of hoe used.  Since hoes are the preferred tool for breaking leaves, this operation does reduce the durability of the tool.
