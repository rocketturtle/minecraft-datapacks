Adds "crafting" recipes to repair wooden and stone tools/weapons with base materials in the crafting square.  So long as you still have the handle, you can repair the tool!

Also, you can "upgrade" and "downgrade" all tools and weapons by following the original recipe, with the same tool as the handle!
