# About

Adds meats and leathers to most every animal. Want to eat a bear steak while you wear your cat-leather boots?  Now you can!

# Details

Extends most of the vanilla animal loot tables with a chance for some new drops.  Vanilla loot tables are still used, as well.  Some new items only drop when the animal is killed by a player.

Since there is not yet a way to create new types of items with data packs, these are mostly renamed versions of existing items.  Even though they've been renamed, they will still work in their original crafting recipes.  The recipe book doesn't seem to auto-fill with them, however.  Hides are normally renamed rabbit hide, and meats are renamed rabbit, mutton, porkchop, or steak (as appropriate).  Some 'flavor' items are renamed dyes (just for fun).
