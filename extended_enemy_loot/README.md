# About

Adds interesting loot drops to non-animal mobs.  Basic gameplay balance is maintained (no enchanted diamond swords drop from zombies), but maybe you'll find a cookie or some nether wart where you didn't expect it.

# Details

Extends most of the vanilla mob loot tables with a chance for some new drops.  Vanilla loot tables are still used, as well.  Most new items only drop when the mob is killed by a player.  New drops are chosen for flavor rather than function, but there is some ingot reblanacing and trophies.

 - Drowned: slightly improved copper ingot drop chance; rarely kelp, sea pickles, turtle eggs, or a random coral fan
