# About

Smelting iron and golden armor pieces yields an ingot in return, instead of only a nugget!

# Details

Smelting iron and golden armor returns a full ingot, and smelting iron and golden tools returns a nugget. Smelting chainmail armor also returns a nugget. Smelting in a blast furnance takes less time.
