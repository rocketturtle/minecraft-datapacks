# About

These data packs are intended to add functionality to "vanilla" Minecraft, without the use of mods.  They focus on expanding loot tables and adding alternate crafting recipes.  Please see the README.md file for each data pack for more information on individual data packs.

# Why So Many Packs?

I've made the decision to seperate each concept into its own data pack.  This is to enable users to pick and choose which behaviors to add to their world, and which to exclude if they wish.  The overhead of running multiple packs appears to be negligible, so performance shouldn't be an issue.  I'm considering bundling each data pack into one "master" data pack for ease of use, perhaps at a later date.

# How to Install

Navigate to your Minecraft world's save directory and locate the 'datapacks' folder.  Copy any or all of these folders to that location and open your Minecraft world.

That's it!  You can confirm that each data pack is installed correctly with the '/datapack list' command (in-game).

# How to Uninstall

For most of these data packs, simply removing the folder from the 'datapacks' folder is enough to uninstall the data pack.  Some data packs use functions, scoreboard objectives, and/or advancements to operate properly, which can get left behind when the data pack folder is deleted.  For those packs, an 'uninstall' function has been provided to clean up any supporting objects before folder deletion.  Please see the README.md file for those specific data packs for more information.
