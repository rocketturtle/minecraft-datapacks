# About

These data packs were designed to add functionality to "vanilla" Minecraft, without the use of mods.  

# How to Install

Navigate to your Minecraft world's save folder and locate the 'datapacks' folder.  Copy any or all of these folder to that location and open your Minecraft world.

That's it!
