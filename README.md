# About

These data packs were designed to add functionality to "vanilla" Minecraft, without the use of mods.  Please see the README.md file for each data pack for more information.

# How to Install

Navigate to your Minecraft world's save directory and locate the 'datapacks' folder.  Copy any or all of these folders to that location and open your Minecraft world.

That's it!  You can confirm that each data pack is installed correctly with the '/datapack list' command (in-game).
