# About

Changes the wool-dyeing recipes to be more like the glass-dyeing recipes.  New recipes are integrated into the vanilla recipe book!

# Details

Replaces the vanilla crafting recipes for dying wool.  A dye of any color surrounded by white wool will yeild 8 wool of that color.  White dye surrounded by any combination of colored wool will yeild 8 white wool.  Works the same for wool carpets.
