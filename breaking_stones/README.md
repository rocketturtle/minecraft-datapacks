# About

Adds crafting recipes to "break" stones to gravel, and gravel to sand (or flint).  Very useful for making concrete.  Also adds recipes for "breaking" other stone types into their base forms.  New recipes are integrated into the vanilla recipe book!

# Details

Adds crafting recipes to break down stone-type blocks into gravel, and gravel into sand or flint.  Recipes are shapeless and follow this format:

 - 8 stone-type blocks, 1 wooden pickaxe -> 8 gravel
 - 8 gravel, 1 wooden pickaxe -> 8 sand
 - 8 gravel, 1 wooden shovel -> 8 flint
 
 The stone-type blocks which convert into gravel are:
 
  - Andesite
  - Basalt
  - Blackstone
  - Cobblestone
  - Deepslate
  - Diorite
  - Granite
  - Mossy Cobblestone

Also adds recipes to break down stone-type derivative blocks (like stairs, walls, slabs, etc) into their base forms.  Recipes are shapeless and follow this basic format:

 - 8 derivative blocks, 1 wooden pickaxe -> 8 base stones
 - 8 derivative slabs, 1 wooden pickaxe -> 4 base stones

The wooden tools are (unfortunately) consumed as part of the recipe.  Why the wooden tools?  They're sort of a placeholder until I find a better way to represent "breaking down" stones in a crafting table, or until Mojang adds a way to reduce tool durability as part of a crafting recipe.  At least the wooden tools are cheap and renewable, if cumbersome to deal with in large batches.
 
 Here is a list of stone types with new recipes:
 
  - Andesite
  - Basalt
  - Blackstone
  - Bricks
  - Deepslate
  - Stone & Cobblestone
  - Diorite
  - Endstone
  - Granite
  - Mossy Cobblestone
  - Netherbricks
  - Prismarine
  - Purpur
  - Red Sandstone
  - Sandstone
